          <h3>AYAZONA PLATFORM</h3>
          <TextStyle>
            Our objective is to link you to our local fulfilment centres (“LFCs”) and allow you to order Items for delivery (our “Service”). Where you order from one of our LFCs, Ayazona processes your order from our Application and manages your experience throughout the order process. Once you have placed an order, your Items will be delivered to you by Ayazona (“Ayazona Fleet”) (each a “Delivery”).
          </TextStyle>

          <TextStyle>
          When you place an order we will tell you an estimated delivery time for your Item before you place the order, but we will attempt delivery as soon as possible; you must therefore be available to accept delivery from the time you place the order. Unfortunately, despite our best efforts, things do not always go to plan and factors such as traffic and weather conditions may prevent us from delivering your Item on time. If your order is more than 30 minutes late, and we haven’t notified you giving you the option to cancel your order, we will work with you to make things right unless you have caused the delay (e.g. because you gave us the wrong address or did not come to the door).
          </TextStyle>

          <TextStyle>
          We will attempt delivery at the address you provide to us when you place your order. If the rider has been dispatched you will be charged for delivery.
          </TextStyle>
          <TextStyle>
          You will still be charged for the Item and for delivery in the event of a failed delivery if you have caused such failure for any reason. Reasons you might cause a delivery to fail include (but are not limited to):
          </TextStyle>
          <ul>
            <li>You do not come to the door, did not pick up the phone when the rider contacted you using the contact information you have provided us and/or you picked up the phone but then failed to provide access within a reasonable amount of time, and the rider is unable to find a safe location to leave the food.</li>
            <li>The rider refuses to deliver the Item to you in accordance with section 8 (Age Restricted Products).</li>
          </ul>
          <TextStyle>
            As provided in greater detail in these Terms, you agree and acknowledge these material terms:
          </TextStyle>
          <ul>
            <li>The Platform is licensed, not sold to you, and you may use the Platform only as set forth in these Terms;</li>
            <li>Your use of the Platform may be subject to separate third party terms of service and fees, including without limitation your mobile network operator’s ("Carrier") terms of service and fees, including fees charged for data usage and overage, which are your sole responsibility;</li>
            <li>You consent to the collection, sharing, and use of your personally identifiable information in accordance with Ayazona’s <Link href="/privacy"><a>Privacy Policy;</a></Link></li>
            <li>The Platform is provided "as is" without warranties of any kind, and Ayazona’s liability to you is limited; and</li>
            <li>Disputes arising under these Terms will be resolved by binding individual arbitration.</li>

          <h3>3. Scope of License</h3>
          <TextStyle>
            The Platform is licensed, not sold, to you for use only under the terms of this license. Ayazona reserves all rights not expressly granted to you. Subject to your complete and ongoing compliance with these Terms, Ayazona hereby grants you a personal, limited, non-sublicensable, non-transferable, and revocable license to access the Platform on compatible devices that you own or control, solely for your own personal, non-commercial use, and only in a manner that complies with all legal requirements that apply to you or your use of the Platform. Ayazona may revoke this license at any time, in its sole discretion.

            You may not modify, alter, reproduce, distribute or make the App available over a network where it could be used by multiple devices at the same time. You may not rent, lease, lend, sell, redistribute or sublicense the App. If you breach these license restrictions, or otherwise exceed the scope of the license granted in these Terms, you may be subject to prosecution and legal damages, as well as liability for infringement of intellectual property rights. These Terms will govern any updates provided to you by Ayazona that replace and/or supplement the original App, unless the upgrade is accompanied by a separate license in which case the terms of that license will govern.
          </TextStyle>
          <h3>4. Payment Terms</h3>
          <TextStyle>
            <h4>4.1. General Payment Terms</h4>
          </TextStyle>
          <h4><i>Platform</i></h4>
          <TextStyle>
            You understand that the prices for product or menu items displayed through the Platform may differ from the prices offered or published by Merchants for the same product or menu items and/or from prices available at other third-party websites/mobile applications. Prices for product or menu items displayed through the Platform may not be the lowest prices at which the product or menu items are sold.
            </TextStyle>
            <TextStyle>
              Because of the nature of the Platform, Ayazona does not always know how much a Merchant will charge for a particular product or menu item. Where your cart includes product or menu items for which Ayazona does not know the exact price to be charged by the Merchant, Ayazona may designate an estimated subtotal for such product and menu items (the “Estimated Subtotal”). Similarly, where Ayazona does not know the exact price of certain or all fees associated with the order, including any applicable taxes and/or Ayazona fees, we may designate an estimate for such fees (the “Estimated Fees”). If you have included product or menu items in your cart that are subject to Estimated Subtotal and/or Estimated Fees, we will provide you with an estimated total. Merchants may charge more or less than the Estimated Subtotal for products or menu items you order. Similarly, we may charge more or less than the Estimated Fees based upon the final prevailing price of Merchant’s goods. In some cases, we may not be able to provide Estimated Subtotal or Estimated Fees, such as when the merchandise cost is unknown or we are otherwise unable to predict fees. Ayazona reserves the right to determine final prevailing pricing of all product or menu items ordered through the Platform. In cases in which prevailing pricing is different than the Estimated Subtotal and/or Estimated Fees, what you are ultimately charged may be different than the estimated total. You acknowledge and agree to pay the prevailing pricing and fees, even if they differ from the Estimated Subtotal and/or Estimated Fees. Please visit our <Link href="https://help.ayazona.com/kb/en/customer-help"><a>Help Center</a></Link> to learn more about how product or menu items are priced.
          </TextStyle>

          <TextStyle>
            Certain features of the Platform, including placing orders, may require you to pay fees to Ayazona. Ayazona may change, or add, fees for use of our Platform at any time as we deem necessary or appropriate for our business. You will have an opportunity to review and accept an estimate of the fees that you will be charged, as applicable. The final fees may differ from the estimate. In all cases, you acknowledge and accept that a fee will be charged and you agree to pay said fee. We encourage you to check our Site or visit our <Link href="https://help.ayazona.com/kb/en/customer-help"><a>Help Center</a></Link> periodically to learn more about how we charge for the Platform.
          </TextStyle>
          <TextStyle>
            Ayazona has no obligation to itemize its costs, profits or margins when publishing prices on the Platform and reserves the right to change such prices at any time, at its discretion. You are liable for all transaction taxes on the Platform provided under these Terms (other than taxes based on Ayazona’s income).
          </TextStyle>
          <TextStyle>
            Ayazona will charge the payment method you specify at the time of purchase or as otherwise specified by you in your account information. We may also place a pre-authorization hold on your payment method, as described in <Link href="#43"><a>Section 4.3</a></Link>.
          </TextStyle>
          <TextStyle>
            Charges paid by you are final and non-refundable, except as expressly provided in <Link href="#49"><a>Section 4.9</a></Link>, and will be quoted in the local currency of the location where the order is being delivered or picked up. Except as expressly provided in <Link href="#49"><a>Section 4.9</a></Link>, Ayazona has no obligation to provide refunds or credits. However, Ayazona, in its sole discretion, may provide users with refunds, wallet topup, courtesy delivery or product credits, or make promotional offers with different features and different rates to any consumers. These credits, wallet balance and offers may be used for future transactions on the Platform. Such credits, wallet balance or offers are non-transferrable, may not be resold, and are not redeemable for cash or other consideration. Ayazona reserves its right to expire, limit, or modify any credits or promotion at any time. If your account is cancelled for any or no reason, you may forfeit any pending, current, or future credits or promotional offers and any other forms of unredeemed value in or associated with your account without prior notice to you.
          </TextStyle>
          <h4 id="referral"><i>Referral Program</i></h4>
          <TextStyle>
            Ayazona may offer a referral program (“Referral Program”), allowing consumers to earn courtesy delivery or product credits, or other promotional rewards (“Referral Program Rewards”) by inviting their eligible friends to register as new Ayazona consumers using a unique referral code (“Referral Program Codes”). Referral Program Codes must be used for the intended audience and purposes, and may not be sold or transferred in any manner or made available to the general public (whether posted to a public forum or otherwise), unless expressly permitted by Ayazona. Referral Program Rewards are non-transferrable, may not be resold, and are not redeemable for cash or other consideration. You agree we may change the terms and conditions of the Referral Program, terminate the Referral Program, or expire, deduct, limit, or modify your Referral Program Rewards at any time for any reason, including but not limited to, the event that Ayazona determines or believes that your participation in the Referral Program or use or redemption of Referral Program Codes was in error, fraudulent, illegal, or otherwise in violation of these Terms. You can learn more about Ayazona’s Referral Program here.
          </TextStyle>
          <h4><i>Ayazona Credits</i></h4>
          <ul>
            <li>The Users of the Ayazona Platform can obtain Ayazona credits (“Ayazona Credits”) e.g. by inviting new users to sign up to the Ayazona Platform. The User can use Ayazona Credits to get a discount on their purchases in the Ayazona Service.</li>
            <li>You can share your code on social media or as a message by pasting the link from your user profile and inserting it where you wish. Your friends will get Ayazona Credits when they use your code for their first order.</li>
            <li>Ayazona may unilaterally determine the conditions applicable to the granting, use and validity of the Ayazona Credits.</li>
            <li>Any signing-up bonus credits can be used only once.</li>
            <li>Ayazona Credits cannot be exchanged to cash.</li>
            <li>The Ayazona Credits will be nullified if Ayazona detects any abuse of Ayazona Credits or suspects or detects that Ayazona Credits have been granted on incorrect grounds. In such cases, Ayazona shall invoice the amount that was paid using such Ayazona Credits.</li>

          <TextStyle>
            <h4>4.2. Unlimited Subscription</h4>
          </TextStyle>

          <TextStyle>
            Ayazona Unlimited (“Unlimited”) is offered as a monthly or yearly pre-paid subscription to the Platform on a per account basis. By signing up for Unlimited and providing us with your payment account information, you are signing up to an auto-renewing subscription requiring recurring payments and agree to pay the then-current applicable fee associated with the subscription.
          </TextStyle>
          <TextStyle>
            If you sign up for the monthly subscription, you will be charged your first monthly subscription fee and any applicable taxes on the date you purchase your subscription or, if your subscription includes a free trial, on the day after your free trial ends. Your subscription will automatically continue on a monthly basis, and you will continue to be charged on a monthly basis at the then-current price (including any applicable taxes), until you cancel your subscription or we terminate it. If you sign up for the yearly subscription, you will be charged your first upfront, non-refundable (except as described below) yearly subscription fee and any applicable taxes on the date you purchase your subscription or, if your subscription includes a free trial, on the day after your free trial ends. Your subscription will automatically continue on a yearly basis at the then-current price (including any applicable taxes), and you will continue to be charged on a yearly basis, until you cancel your subscription or we terminate it. You can find your monthly and/or yearly subscription renewal/billing date in your account settings.
          </TextStyle>
          <TextStyle>
            If your subscription includes a free trial, you will not be charged the applicable fee during your free trial. To obtain the free trial you will be required to provide a credit card in order to ensure uninterrupted access to Unlimited and continued use after the expiration of the free trial. Upon completion of your free trial, your subscription will automatically convert into a paid Unlimited subscription and your payment method will be charged the applicable fee unless you have cancelled your Unlimited subscription. You may cancel your Unlimited subscription as described below. You may not receive a notice from us that your free trial has ended or that the paying portion of your Unlimited subscription has begun. You are only permitted one free trial. If your Unlimited subscription is ever terminated for any reason, and you purchase an additional Unlimited subscription, you shall not be eligible for a free trial on any subsequent Unlimited subscriptions.
          </TextStyle>
          
          <TextStyle>
            We may change the subscription terms or fees at any time on a going forward basis in our discretion. If the pricing for your subscription increases, we will notify you, and provide you an opportunity to change your subscription before applying those changes to your account or charging your payment details in connection with an automatic renewal. The notification will inform you of how long you have to change your subscription before the changes become effective. Your continued use of Unlimited after the changes become effective will constitute your acceptance of the changes. If you do not wish to continue subscribing with the new fees or features, you may cancel your subscription. If you accept the new subscription, its terms and conditions will apply for that renewal and all renewals going forward. For information on the monthly and yearly subscription fees and terms, please visit the <Link href="/unlimited"><a>Ayazona Unlimited Page</a></Link>.
          </TextStyle>
          
          <TextStyle>
            You may cancel your subscription at any time in your account settings or by contacting us via our <Link href="/contact"> <a> Contacts Center</a></Link>. You must cancel your subscription before it renews to avoid billing of the next periodic subscription fees to your account. However, if you cancel a pre-paid yearly or monthly subscription, you will not receive any refund. If you cancel your monthly or yearly subscription, you will be able to use your Unlimited subscription for the remainder of your pre-paid subscription term.
          </TextStyle>
          <TextStyle>
            We may terminate your subscription for Unlimited at our discretion and without any notice. If we cancel your yearly subscription for Unlimited, we will give you a prorated refund based on the amount of time remaining in your pre-paid subscription; provided, however, that Ayazona will not be obligated to grant you a refund if we terminate your account or your subscription because we determine, in our sole discretion, that your actions or your use of the Platform violates these Terms or has harmed another user.

            <h3>4.3. Payment Authorization</h3>
          </TextStyle>
          <TextStyle>
            You authorize Ayazona to charge all sums for orders that you make to the payment method designated in your account. When you place an order order through Ayazona, a temporary pre-authorization hold is placed on your designated payment method to verify that the card is valid and has funds available for your intended purchase. The amount of this pre-authorization hold may be greater or less than the order total quoted at checkout. However, your payment will be captured up to 24 hours after your order is completed or cancelled. In the event that the pre-authorization is greater than the final amount, the difference will be released after your order is completed or cancelled; depending on your bank, it may take up to 5 business days to receive access to these released funds.
          </TextStyle>
          <TextStyle>
            Ayazona also places an initial temporary pre-authorization hold on each new payment method you add to your account.

            If payment due on your account is delinquent, we reserve the right to suspend or terminate your access to the Platform; your account information may be sent to a collection agency/debt collector and you may be subject to a collection action, and payment of collection related fees and costs. If any fee for your Unlimited subscription is not paid in a timely manner, we reserve the right to revoke access to your Unlimited subscription and use of Ayazona. If you do not bring your Ayazona balance current after we provide you with notification that your account is in arrears, we reserve the right to suspend or terminate your access to your Unlimited subscription or convert your Unlimited subscription to a non-subscription account. You will be responsible for paying all past due amounts. If you have questions regarding an outstanding balance on your account, please contact us via our <Link href="/contact"> <a> Contacts Center</a></Link>.
          </TextStyle>
          <TextStyle>
            If your payment card expires or is replaced by your issuing bank, the card network may provide us with updated card details associated with the same account. We may use these new details in order to help prevent any interruption to the Platform. If you would like to use a different payment method or remove a saved payment method from your account, please visit your account settings to update your billing information.

For alcohol items, the Courier reserves the right, at his or her discretion, to refuse delivery and return the item(s) if the name on your ID does not match the name on your order, if you are not at least twenty-one (21) years old ("Legal Age"), if you cannot provide a bona-fide government-issued photo identification that shows you are of Legal Age, or if you are visibly intoxicated.

            In the interest of resolving Disputes between you and Ayazona in the most expedient and cost effective manner, you and Ayazona agree that every Dispute arising in connection with these Terms will be resolved by binding individual arbitration. Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, and can be subject to very limited review by courts. While the parties will be permitted to engage in discovery or exchange of non-privileged information relevant to the dispute, arbitration may allow for more limited discovery allowed for in court. Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award. Our agreement to arbitrate disputes includes all claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of these Terms, the Platform, or your relationship with us, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, and regardless of whether a claim arises during or after the termination of these Terms.

            <h4>17.3. Exceptions</h4>
          </TextStyle>

          <TextStyle>
            Despite the provisions of the paragraph directly above, we both agree that nothing in these Terms will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit the right of either of us to: (1) Bring an individual action in small claims court; (2) Pursue an enforcement action through the applicable government, county, or local agency if that action is available; or (3) File suit in a court of law to address an intellectual property infringement claim.

            <h4>17.4. Notice Process</h4>
          </TextStyle>

          <TextStyle>
            A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the Dispute to the other, by certified mail, or if we do not have a physical address on file for you, by electronic mail ("Notice").
          </TextStyle>

          <TextStyle>
            The Notice must: (1) Describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (2) Set forth the specific relief sought ("Demand").
          </TextStyle>
          <TextStyle>
            We agree to use good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if we do not reach an agreement to do so within thirty (30) days after the Notice is received, you or Ayazona may commence an arbitration proceeding. To start an arbitration, you must do the following:
          </TextStyle>
          <TextStyle>
            During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or Ayazona must not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any.
          </TextStyle>
          <TextStyle>
            <h4>17.5. Fees</h4>
          </TextStyle>

          <TextStyle>
            If you are a resident of Kenya, arbitration may take place in the county where you reside at the time of filing. For individuals residing outside Kenya, arbitration shall be initiated in the County of Nairobi, Kenya. You and Ayazona further agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of any government or county court in Nairobi County, Kenya in order to compel arbitration, to stay proceedings pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate, or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator. If a claim is for KES 100,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted: (1) Solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator; or (2) Through a non-appearance based telephone hearing.
          </TextStyle>
          <TextStyle>
            If the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Government Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all fees will be governed by the Local Courts Rules. In that case, you agree to reimburse Ayazona for all monies previously disbursed by it that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the Local Courts Rules. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator must issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based.
          </TextStyle>

          <TextStyle>
            The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within fourteen (14) days of the arbitrator’s ruling on the merits.
          </TextStyle>

          <TextStyle>
            <h4>17.6. No Class or Representative Actions</h4>
          </TextStyle>

          <TextStyle>
            YOU AND AYAZONA AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.
          </TextStyle>

          <TextStyle>
            Further, unless both you and Ayazona agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. If any court or arbitrator determines that this “No Class or Representative Actions” section is void or unenforceable for any reason or that an arbitration can proceed on a class or representative basis, then the arbitration provisions set forth above shall be deemed null and void in their entirety and the parties shall be deemed to have not agreed to arbitrate disputes.

            <h4>17.7. 30-Day Right to Opt Out</h4>
          </TextStyle>

          <TextStyle>
            You have the right to opt out and not be bound by the arbitration and class action waiver provisions set forth above by submitting a request <Link href="/contact"><a>here</a></Link>. The notice must be sent within thirty (30) days of your creating an account with Ayazona or the effective date of the first set of Terms containing a Dispute Resolution and Arbitration section, whichever is later; otherwise, you shall be bound to arbitrate disputes in accordance with the terms of these paragraphs. If you opt out of these arbitration provisions, Ayazona also will not be bound by them. NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY HEREIN, NOTHING IN THIS AGREEMENT SHALL SUPERSEDE, AMEND, OR MODIFY THE TERMS OF ANY SEPARATE AGREEMENT(S) BETWEEN YOU AND AYAZONA RELATING TO YOUR WORK AS AN EMPLOYEE OR USE OF THE PLATFORM AS AN INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR AGREEMENT (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE FLEET AGREEMENT) GOVERNING YOUR SERVICES AS A CONTRACTOR. FOR THE AVOIDANCE OF DOUBT, IF YOU ARE AN INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR, OPTING OUT OF THE ARBITRATION AGREEMENT SET FORTH IN THIS SECTION 17 WILL NOT AFFECT ANY AGREEMENT BY YOU TO ARBITRATE DISPUTES COVERED BY YOUR INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR AGREEMENT (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE FLEET AGREEMENT) WITH AYAZONA.

            <h4>17.8. Modifications</h4>
          </TextStyle>

          <TextStyle>
            Except for inconsequential changes that do not affect any rights or obligations herein, Ayazona will provide thirty (30) days' notice of any changes to this section by posting on the Platform, sending you a message, or otherwise notifying you when you are logged into your account. Amendments will become effective thirty (30) days after they are posted on the Platform or sent to you, or otherwise notified when you are logged into your account. Changes to this section will otherwise apply prospectively only to claims arising after the thirtieth (30th) day. If a court or arbitrator decides that this subsection on "Modifications" is not enforceable or valid, then this subsection shall be severed from the section entitled “Dispute Resolution and Arbitration,” and the court or arbitrator shall apply the first Dispute Resolution and Arbitration section in existence after you began using the Platform. You may otherwise reject the change by sending us written notice within thirty (30) days of the change to Ayazona’s address for Notice, in which case your account with Ayazona will be immediately terminated and this arbitration provision, as in effect immediately prior to the amendments you reject, will survive.

          <TextStyle>
            Except as explicitly described in the Dispute Resolution and Arbitration section, material changes to these Terms will be effective upon the earlier of: (1) Your first use of the Platform with actual notice of such change, or (2) thirty (30) days from posting of such change.

Except as explicitly described in the Dispute Resolution and Arbitration section, if any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable, such provision shall be struck and the remaining provisions shall be enforced to the fullest extent under law. The failure of Ayazona to enforce any right or provision in these Terms shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision unless acknowledged and agreed to by Ayazona in writing.
